Windows will default to opening your Tableau workbooks and data sources (TWB, TWBX etc) in the most recent version of Tableau you installed.

In most cases this is desired behaviour, for example when you upgrade to the latest release you typically want it to also be the default. Sometimes there are cases where you’ve installed a newer version but you want an older version to be the default, such cases may be beta or alpha programs, or if your central IT team manages upgrades for Tableau.

In the cases where you’d like to run a default to a previously installed version of Tableau, I find simply running the Repair option from Programs and Features in Windows will update your defaults.
